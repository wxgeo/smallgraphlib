    # we only need a quick approximation.
    # Let's call `A` the first point, `B` the second one, and `I` the middle of the segment `(A B)`.
    # The maximal distance between the segment `(A, B)` and the edge is when the label is positioned

    #
    # The point `C` is the barycenter corresponding to the coefficient `k` on the segment (A B),
    # and is easy to compute.
    # However, we want the coordinates of the point `P`, which is the real position of the tikz label
    # on the curved edge for the same coefficient `k`.
    # So, we have to calculate an approximation of the vector `C->P`.
    #
    # (Note that the vectors `J->N` and `C->P` are not exactly orthogonal to the vector `A->B`,

    # Experimentally, on a tikz drawing, the distance `IM` is approximately `0.006 * bending * AB`,
    # where `bending` is the value of the `bending` parameter of tikz.
    #
    # For the distance `JN`, still experimentally, the distance is approximately `0.0045 * bending * AB`
    # (so 0.0045 instead of 0.006/2 = 0.003, because of the curving of course).
    #
    # Since the edge is only slightly curved, we can now approximate `A --> N` and `N --> M`
    # portions of curves by a straight line.
    # Then, on each straight line, the distance between the edge and the `(A, B)` segment is
    # proportional to the position of the label on the edge.
    #
    # If 0 <= k <= 0.25, the distance from the label to the segment is approximately `4 * k * JN`.
    # (since for k = 0.25, the distance is of course `JN` itself).
    # If 0.75 <= k <= 1, the distance is `4 * (1 - k) * JN`.
    # So the approximation formula if abs(0.5 - k) > 0.25 is:
    #
    #                           `distance CP = 4 * min(k, 1 - k) * JN`
    #
    # So, `CP = 4 * min(k, 1 - k) * 0.0045 * bending * AB` and finally:
    #
    #                            `CP = 0.018 * bending * min(k, 1 - k) * AB`
    #
    # Now, if 0.25 <= k <= 0.5, the distance from the label to the segment is approximately
    # `JN + 4 * (k - 0.25) * (IM - JN)`, since for k = 0.25, the distance is of course `JN` itself,
    # and for k = 0.5, the distance is `IM`.
    # So the approximation formula for abs(0.5 - k) < 0.25 is:
    #
    #                       `distance CP = JN + 4 * min(k - 0.25, 0.75 - k) * (IM - JN)`
    #
    # This leads to:
    #
    #                       `CP = (0.006 * min(k - 0.25, 0.75 - k) + 0.0045) * bending * AB`
    #
    # The vector `I->M` is orthogonal to `A->B`, and its length is approximately `0.006 * bending * AB`.
    # So its coordinates are `0.006 * bending * (-yAB, xAB)` for a left bending.
    #
    # It follows that C->P coordinates are:
    #
    #              `C->P = | 0.018 * bending * min(k, 1 - k) * (-yAB, xAB)` if abs(0.5 - k) > 0.25
